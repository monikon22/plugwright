# @plugwright/auth-authme

Reference [plugwright](https://github.com/Drownek/plugwright) authentication plugin for a server running AuthMe, or anything else that asks for a password in chat.

On every bot connection — the first bot of a test, a second bot from `createPlayer()`, every `player.rejoin()`, and the `external` mode's admin-bot console — it waits for the server's prompt and answers it. Registration is followed through to the login it triggers, because a command sent between the two is still rejected as unauthenticated.

Microsoft (online-mode) accounts are left alone; AuthMe never prompts them.

## Usage

```kotlin
environments {
    create("staging", ExternalMode) {
        accounts {
            autoRegister {
                usernamePattern.set("pw_%04d")
                password.set(secret.env("BOT_PASSWORD"))
                max.set(4)
            }
        }
        plugins {
            npm("@plugwright/auth-authme") {
                options["loginCommand"] = "/log"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The same block works on a `LocalMode` environment. A local server running AuthMe puts up the same wall as a remote one.

## Which command it sends

The server decides, not the account. `account.justCreated` is a hint from the account pool, and it is wrong every time a pool account outlives the run that created it — that is the second run against any stand. So the plugin waits for either prompt and answers whichever arrived. The register pattern is tested first, since AuthMe's register prompt mentions the password too and would otherwise look like a login prompt.

## Options

| Option | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `loginCommand` | `/login` | Sent with the password appended |
| `registerCommand` | `/register` | Sent with the password twice |
| `loginPromptPattern` | `log ?in\|password` | Regex identifying the login prompt |
| `registerPromptPattern` | `regist` | Regex identifying the register prompt |
| `successPattern` | `success\|welcome\|logged in\|authenticat` | Regex confirming the command was accepted |
| `authenticatedPattern` | `logged in\|authenticat` | Narrower regex confirming the player is actually authenticated |
| `timeoutMs` | `15000` | How long to wait for each prompt or confirmation |
| `password` | — | Fallback password for accounts that carry none |

All patterns are matched case-insensitively, and only against messages that arrived after the step they belong to. A greeting containing the word "welcome" would otherwise pass for a login confirmation, and the test would start before the player could run a single command.

`password` covers accounts an environment invents rather than leases: `LocalMode` hands every test a throwaway `Test_<uuid>` with no password of its own. Plugin options travel as plain strings, so use it only where the password protects nothing — a local server that is deleted after the run. Anywhere else, put the accounts in `accounts { }`, where the password stays a secret reference until the runner reads it.

## Preflight test

A `preflight` test ships with the plugin and runs before any user spec. The handshake above already throws on the first connection if it fails, so the test mostly exists to put a named failure at the top of the report instead of a stack trace buried in someone else's test.

## Server-side settings that matter

A stock AuthMe config is tuned for humans and rejects a test suite in three specific ways. On a disposable local server:

```yaml
settings:
    registration:
        dialog:
            preJoin: { enable: false }    # bots cannot answer a dialog
            postJoin: { enable: false }
    restrictions:
        maxRegPerIp: 0                    # every test registers from 127.0.0.1
Protection:
    enableAntiBot: false                  # a test suite looks exactly like a bot attack
```

The `example_plugin` in this repository writes that file through `writeFiles { }` and runs its full suite against it.
